# AI/ML Analysis Working Group (AWG)

**OSDR AWGs Overview**  
The [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) is a science collaboration initiative that provides an open-access data system designed to help scientists discover and access space-relevant datasets to perform primary, secondary, and meta-analyses. OSDR has established the Analysis Working Groups (AWGs) with the goal of optimizing the metadata, data, and features available to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such rare and complex datasets. The AWGs will assess and improve the effectiveness of the OSDR through intensive utilization of OSDR resources and generate higher-order data. This GitHub repository is dedicated for AI/ML AWG members to share and collaborate their work and codes.

**AI/ML AWG Overview**  
The Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) Analysis Working Group (AWG) is intended as a forum for soliciting feedback from subject matter experts on the development of machine learning and artificial intelligence readiness of data within the [NASA Open Science Data Repositories](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/), including [GeneLab](https://genelab.nasa.gov/) and [ALSDA](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/about/alsda.html). These efforts will maximize the use of existing data for the development of new training datasets and pre-trained models using AI/ML methodologies for the purpose of enabling new knowledge discoveries. The AWG will assess and provide feedback on the AI-readiness of data held in the Open Science Data Repositories, by iteratively conducting collaborative AI/ML analyses of the data held in these repositories.
