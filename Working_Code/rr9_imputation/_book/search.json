Addressing this issue, this research presents strategies that integrate AI and digital twin technology to overcome the limitations posed by sparse datasets in space biology research.\nBy presenting a cohesive strategy that combines synthetic data generation, automatic labeling, and advanced machine learning with digital twins, we showcase an application to the RR9 dataset at OSDR. This research aims to overcome the challenge of data scarcity in space biology, thereby forging a way to unlock insights into the potential of life beyond Earth.",

    "text": "1.2 RR9 Background\nThe Rodent Research 9 payload consisted of three space biology experiments designed to examine impacts of long-duration spaceflight on visual impairment and joint tissue degradation that affect astronauts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation\nPurpose\nExperiments\n\n\n\n\nInvestigation 1\nEffects of microgravity on fluid shifts and increased fluid pressures that occur in the head.\n1. To determine whether spaceflight on the ISS alters rodent basilar artery spontaneous tone, myogenic and KCl (Potassium Chloride)-evoked vasoconstriction, mechanical stiffness and gross structure. 2. To estimate whether spaceflight on the ISS alters the blood-brain barrier in rodents, as indicated by ultrastructural examination of the junctional complex of the cerebral capillary endothelium. 3. To determine whether spaceflight on the ISS alters rodent basal vein (inside cranium) and jugular vein (outside cranium) spontaneous tone, myogenic and KCl-evoked constriction, distension, and gross structure. 4. To determine whether spaceflight on the ISS alters the ability of the cervical lymphatics to modulate lymph flow, and thus, regulate cerebral fluid homeostasis.\n\n\nInvestigation 2\nImpact of spaceflight on the vessels that supply blood to the eyes.\n1. Define the relationships between spaceflight condition-induced oxidative stress in reactive oxygen species (ROS) expression and retinal vascular remodeling and BRB function in mice return to Earth alive. 2. Determine whether spaceflight condition-induced oxidative damage in retina is mediated through photoreceptor mitochondrial ROS production.\n\n\nInvestigation 3\nExtent of knee and hip joint degradation caused by prolonged exposure to weightlessness.\n1. Determine the extent of knee and hip joint degradation in mice after 30 days of spaceflight on the ISS. 2. Use the DigiGait System to assess gait patterns before and after returning from the ISS.\n\n\n\nWe are interested in the Retinal data and all things related to Eye. So, all the experiments related to Investigation 1 and 2 will be studied here. Below is the table of all OSD identifiers related to above investigations obtained from https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/repo/data/payloads/RR-9\n\n\n\nIdentifier\nTitle\nFactors\nAssay Types\n\n\n\n\nOSD-557\nSpaceflight influences gene expression, photoreceptor integrity, and oxidative stress related damage in the murine retina (RR-9)\nSpaceflight\nBone MicrostructureMolecular Cellular Imaginghistology\n\n\nOSD-568\nCharacterization of mouse ocular responses (Microscopy) to a 35-day (RR-9) spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations\nSpaceflight\nMolecular Cellular Imaging\n\n\nOSD-715\nCharacterization of mouse ocular response to a 35-day spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations - Proteomics data\nSpaceflight\nprotein expression profiling\n\n\nOSD-255\nSpaceflight influences gene expression, photoreceptor integrity, and oxidative stress-related damage in the murine retina\nSpaceflight\ntranscription profiling\n\n\nOS-140\nSpace Flight Environment Induces Remodeling of Vascular Network and Glia-Vascular Communication in Mouse Retina\nSpaceflight\n\n\n\nOSD-583\nCharacterization of mouse ocular responses (intraocular pressure) to a 35-day (RR-9) spaceflight mission: Evidence of blood-retinal barrier disruption and ocular adaptations\nSpaceflight\nTonometry\n\n\n\nThe purpose of this notebook is to combine all retina data from the Rodent Research 9 (RR9) mission from the NASA Open Science Data Repository, perform exploratory data analysis, impute missing data and train a digital twin.\nOriginal Author: Lauren Sanders\nAdditional Author(s): Jian Gong, Vaishnavi Nagesh",
